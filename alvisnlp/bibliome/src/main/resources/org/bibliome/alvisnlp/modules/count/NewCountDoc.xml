  <synopsis>
    <p>Counts element occurrences and writes the results in a file, including <em>tfidf</em>.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param name="documents"/> as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element. Items in the result are hereby called <em>documents</em> even though they are not required to be AlvisNLP/ML documents (they are documents in the tfidf meaning of the term). Then <pram name="target"/> is evaluated as a list of elements with the document as the context element. The values of the feature <param name="featureKey"/> are stored and counted. Results (occurrences and tfidf) for each distinct value are written in human and machine readable formats (<param name="countFile"/> and <param name="tfidfFile"/> respectively).</p>
