  <synopsis>
    <p>Maps the value of an annoation feature according to a mapping file.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> looks for the value of the feature <param name="sourceFeature"/> of each annotation in the layer <param name="mappedLayerName"/> in the mapping dictionnary defined in <param name="mappingFile"/>. This file must contain one entry for each line, the first column is the key searched for. When the source feature value is found in the mapping, <this/> adds features to the annotation: the feature names are given in <param name="targetFeatures"/> and the values are given by the columns in the mapping file. Empty feature names in <pram name="targetFeatures"/> do not add a feature to the annotation.</p>
