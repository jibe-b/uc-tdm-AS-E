  <synopsis>
    <p>Searches for entries in a dictionary generated by an expression.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> searches on <param name="subject"/> for entries generated by the expressions <param name="values"/> and <param name="key"/>. <this/> evaluates <param name="values"/> as a list of elements, the result represent the entries of the dictionary. For each entry, <this/> evaluates <param name="key"/> as a string with the entry as the context element, thus generating the entry key. When <this/> finds a match, then it sets all the features specified in <param name="features"/>: the value of the feature is the expression evaluated with the matched entry as the context element.</p>
