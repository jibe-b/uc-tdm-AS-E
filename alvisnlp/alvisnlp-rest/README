This project is a REST interface for alvisNLP/ML. It enables to manage Alvis 
through REST services by using HTTP methods. It is composed of two levels :

1)  The fist level handles the aspects concerning the description 
	and presentation of the alvisNLP/ML resources. It includes asking 
	for the list of components (libraries, modules, converters) and 
	metadata of specific modules. Possible requests are :

--- Asking for the list of the modules

		GET	[#BASE_PATH]/components/modules
			
--- Asking for the list of converters

		GET	[#BASE_PATH]/components/converters
			
--- Asking for the list of libraries  

		GET	[#BASE_PATH]/components/libraries
			
--- Asking for a specific components  

		GET	[#BASE_PATH]/components/<$component_type>/<$name_of_the_modules>.
			 
    The variable <$component_type> may be the keyword *modules*, *converters* or *libraries*. 
    The variable <$name_of_the_modules> may be the exact name of any component present of the <$component_type>.

--- Asking for a specific property of a component 

        GET [#BASE_PATH]/<$component_type>/<$name_of_the_modules>/<$property_name>
            
    The variable <$component_type> may be the keyword *modules*, *converters* or *libraries*. 
    The variable <$name_of_the_modules> may be the exact name of any component present in the <$component_type>.
    The variable <$property_name> may be any property of the component <$name_of_the_modules> present of the <$component_type>. 
    Examples of properties for a module are *description*, *parameters*, etc.
